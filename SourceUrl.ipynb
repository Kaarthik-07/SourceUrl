This early version is documented in Jordan Walke's GitHub repository.[1] Influences for the project included XHP, an HTML component library for PHP.\\n\\nReact was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and subsequently integrated into Instagram in 2012.[56] In May 2013, at JSConf US, the project was officially open-sourced, marking a significant turning point in its adoption and growth.[2]\\n\\nReact Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.\\n\\nOn April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new set of internal algorithms for rendering, as opposed to React's old rendering algorithm, Stack.[57] React Fiber was to become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the React library.[58][needs update] The actual syntax for programming with React does not change; only the way that the syntax is executed has changed.[59] React's old rendering system, Stack, was developed at a time when the focus of the system on dynamic change was not understood. Stack was slow to draw complex animation, for example, trying to accomplish all of it in one chunk. Fiber breaks down animation into segments that can be spread out over multiple frames. Likewise, the structure of a page can be broken into segments that may be maintained and updated separately. JavaScript functions and virtual DOM objects are called \\\"fibers\\\", and each can be operated and updated separately, allowing for smoother on-screen rendering.[60]\\n\\nOn September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the public.[61]\\n\\nOn October 20, 2020, the React team released React v17.0, notable as the first major release without major changes to the React developer-facing API.[62]\\n\\n^ Clark, Andrew (September 26, 2017). \\\"React v16.0§MIT licensed\\\".
